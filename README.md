# Pandabook

A simple social network application.

As a Panda, in order to connect with other Pandas, I can:

* Create an account and log in
* Send a friend request to another registered Panda
* Send a private message to a Panda on my friend list
* Send a public gift to a Panda on my friend list

## Beyond Rails

* Implement a JS front-end framework
* Implement real-time messaging with websockets
